I've been reading up on the latest technological advances and things have changed so much since I left that cupboard. Apparently the \"internet\" has taken over the world and revolutionized the way muggles work, play, interact, and live their daily lives.\n\nI wonder sometimes if I could be a muggle. If you think about it, there are just as many unhappy muggles as there are happy wizards. Magic doesn't seem to be a silver bullet for the common human ailments: loneliness, illness, evil...  If you think about it, how much does magic change human behavior? You think Voldemort is a bad seed? Check out news clippings from the muggle world and you'll find his equals.\n\nMaybe I should take a muggle studies class. Or I guess I can just ask Hermione."}
